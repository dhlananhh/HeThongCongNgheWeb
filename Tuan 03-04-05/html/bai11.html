            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the
            language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG, and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications,
            and user interfaces for many mobile applications. [1]

            CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts. [2] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
            the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition the structural content.
